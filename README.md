# go-pride

## What is "go-pride"?
The go-pride project introduces a new command for your Terminals. It's basically a go program that allows you to show your pride flag! 🏳️‍🌈😃

## Installation

## Configuration

## Credits
I have been inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/ExperiBass/cli-pride-flags) of [ExperiBass](https://github.com/ExperiBass).
It's a good solution, but I wanted to be able to scale it and also use it as my terminal welcome screen (bashrc). 
Also I wanted to learn Go and this was a fitting first project 😉
